        <h1>Welcome to Our Love Story!</h1>
        <p class="intro-text">
            Here is the website I made for my lovely princess. We first met back in 12th grade, just two young hearts crossing paths without ever imagining where life would take us. Over the years, our bond has only grown stronger, and with every moment we’ve shared, I’ve come to realize just how lucky I am to have her in my life. I cherish her more than words can express, and from the bottom of my heart, I wish to stay by her side forever—through every joy, every challenge, and every chapter that lies ahead.
